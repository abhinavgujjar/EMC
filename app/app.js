Rooms have every modern convenience with top notch fittings in the bathroom, fantastic rain shower, electronic keypad based controls for lights etc., very comfortable bed, great lighting etc. The lobby is nice but not gigantic like that of a 5-star hotel but elegantly sufficient. The restaurant is fine for a night's dinner and a decent breakfast - although the food quality was fine it could stand some improvement. Friendly, attentive staff. Good location. Will stay there again.",

The complementary breakfast buffet was simply awesome and delicious. Here I wud say that they match a five star hotel. About the cons, the staffs during check in were not bothered about welcoming, with no one to even carry the luggages it was a mere rude welcome I must say. The restaurant food there if u must have it is so expensive so better to dine out. Overall it is a very good stay. Cheers to Ramada people",

		"description": "I had a terrible experience of staying at Ibis Hosur road for two nights. Had expected a upmarket hotel as the rates at Ibis was equivalent to those charged by other 3 star hotels. Issued faced : Airconditioning wasn't working in the first night. Had to call reception at 4 am and asked for a single bedsheet as it was hot. Only one common low end iron box along with stand available across all floors. The iron box works only at a particular setting. I had to do a quick iron in the second day morning and had to call the room service to get my shirt ironed. Free WIFI is advertised. But it is only 256kbps connection. Rooms are pretty small and chairs were dirty. Even you need to swipe your room access card to use the life. First time I am facing this. The second day morning, I met the manager and complained about the airconditioning. She agreed to have it looked into. But when I came in the night, nothing was changed. After complaining again, they sent the technician. First he said that nothing is wrong. I called reception again and then he checked the system again and rectified the problem (blockage in the air vents). Ibis at Hosur road is not worth the amount we are paying unless you don't get better deals else where. Won't stay there again. Stayed November 2014, travelled on business",
